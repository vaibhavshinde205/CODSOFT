# Tic Tac Toe AI – Minimax Algorithm (Task 2)

This project is an **AI-based Tic Tac Toe game** developed as part of the **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The game allows a human to play against an **unbeatable AI** that uses the **Minimax Algorithm**.

---

## Description

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to games.  
The AI player evaluates all possible future game states using the Minimax algorithm and chooses the optimal move, making it impossible to defeat.

The system also includes proper input validation and handles incorrect user inputs without crashing.

## Features

- Human vs AI gameplay  
- AI uses **Minimax Algorithm**  
- AI is unbeatable (best possible outcome is a draw)  
- Detects win, loss, and draw conditions  
- Handles invalid inputs (blank, letters, out-of-range numbers)  
- Clear game board display in terminal  

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Minimax Algorithm  
- Game Tree Search  
- Recursion  
- Input Validation  
- Conditional Logic
