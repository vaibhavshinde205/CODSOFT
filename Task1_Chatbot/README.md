# Rule-Based Chatbot (Task 1)

This project is a **rule-based AI chatbot** developed as part of the **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The chatbot interacts with users using predefined rules and responds based on keywords and simple logic.

---

## Description

The chatbot simulates basic conversation with a user. It can greet users, answer simple questions, perform basic arithmetic operations, and even tell jokes and motivational quotes using external text files.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **Artificial Intelligence**, such as rule-based systems, input handling, and conversational flow.

## Features

- Greets user and remembers their name  
- Responds to common conversation inputs  
- Tells current time and date  
- Performs arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
- Tells random jokes (from `jokes.txt`)  
- Gives motivational quotes (from `motivation.txt`)  
- Handles invalid and unknown inputs gracefully
